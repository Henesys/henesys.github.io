## How Did I Get Here?

> "Having a project, even if it's terrible, is better than no project at all."

At the end of 2024, I did not expect to enter the job market after completing my master's degree.

Initially, I had planned to graduate, move back to South Korea, serve my mandatory military conscription and start working.

Instead, on the day of my finals, I read news about how the [president of South Korea declared martial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_South_Korean_martial_law_crisis), setting off a massive flurry of information (both real and fake), ranging from something as serious as a North Korean invasion to something as trivial as a bad joke that gained a bit of traction.

Needless to say, the aftermath of this issue and the consequences that followed have not left me impressed. Therefore, after days of deliberation, I decided to enter the job market in mid-January.

Finding myself woefully unprepared and outmatched by other candidates after dozens of applications, I decided to get back to basics and approach the goal of getting a job offer like an assignment: something I've done for years at this point.

After seeing testimonies (and complaints) about how recruiters constantly see the same Kaggle Titanic competition "project", COVID-19 dataset analysis and TODO app, I decided to start a project using a dataset I collected by myself and try to make something useful out of it.
